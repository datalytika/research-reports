## ‚ö° **Project Proposals**

<p align="center">
  <img width="70%" height="70%" src="https://i.imgur.com/cJBnLkm.jpg" alt="Project Proposals">
</p>

- We already have the data you need in our databases (Likelihood 99.5%)
- Our analysts will draft the project proposal from scratch
- We'll do the visualizations and infographics
- Easy and just spend from a minimum of $150 for simple projects

 ### **Types of project proposals**

  1. Solicited Project Proposal: A solicited project proposal is sent as a response to a request for proposal (RFP). Here you‚Äôll need to adhere to the RFP guidelines of the project owner.
  2. Unsolicited Project Proposal: You can send project proposals without having received a request for proposal. This can happen in open bids for construction projects, where a project owner receives unsolicited project proposals from many contractors.
  3. Informal Project Proposal: This type of project proposal is created when a client asks for an informal proposal, without an RFP.
  4. Renewal Project Proposal: You can use a renewal project proposal when you are reaching out to past customers. The advantage is that you can highlight past positive results and future benefits.
  5. Continuation Project Proposal: Sent to investors and stakeholders to communicate project progress.
  6. Supplemental Project Proposal: This proposal is sent to investors to ask for additional resources during the project execution phase.
